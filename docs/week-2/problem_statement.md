# Deep-Dive into the Problem

## Who?

The primary users are office workers who spend long hours sitting at desks (e.g., knowledge workers, managers, developers, marketers). They value productivity but often neglect posture and movement throughout the workday.  
Secondary users include HR managers and employers who want to improve employee well-being and reduce absenteeism.  
Tertiary users could include physiotherapists and ergonomics consultants who use posture data to enhance treatment and prevention plans.

## What?

Office workers often unconsciously develop poor sitting habits—like slouching, leaning forward, or sitting for extended periods without breaks.
These habits contribute to back and neck pain, fatigue, reduced focus, and long-term musculoskeletal issues.
Currently, workers have no simple, objective way to monitor or correct posture in real time, making the problem persist unnoticed until it manifests as discomfort or injury.

## Where/When?

This problem occurs during work hours, typically in office or home-office environments. It’s most common during periods of high concentration when employees forget to take breaks or adjust their posture. The issue surfaces throughout the day but intensifies during long meetings, deadlines, or extended computer use.

## Why?

Addressing this problem is crucial because:

- Poor posture and prolonged sitting are major contributors to chronic back and neck pain.
- Health issues from sedentary work lead to lost productivity and increased absenteeism.
- Employers face rising costs related to healthcare claims and reduced employee engagement.
- Early detection and prevention can help workers build healthier habits, reducing long-term risks.
- Objective insights into posture create opportunities for physiotherapists and consultants to provide more effective interventions.

## Current Situation

- Workers rely mostly on self-awareness or ad-hoc ergonomic advice, which is easy to ignore.
- Employers may provide adjustable chairs or standing desks, but without behavior tracking, these tools are underutilized.
- Wearables and fitness trackers provide movement reminders, but they rarely address posture directly or in a workplace-specific context.
- No widespread, automated, vision-based tool exists to provide personalized posture feedback in real-time for office settings.

## Problem Statement

Office workers who spend long hours sitting struggle with unconscious habits such as slouching, leaning forward, and sitting for extended periods without breaks. These behaviors reduce comfort, focus, and long-term health, while increasing risks of chronic pain and absenteeism. Since there are no simple, automated ways to track or correct posture in real time, individuals rely on self-awareness or generic ergonomic advice, which often fails to change behavior. This results in ongoing health issues, lost productivity, and higher costs for both employees and employers.
