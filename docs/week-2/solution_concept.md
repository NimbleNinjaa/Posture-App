# Concept

Leverage **edge-based computer vision** to analyze an office worker’s posture and sitting behavior in real time. The system generates **personalized insights and actionable recommendations**—such as reminding users to sit upright, adjust their chair/monitor position, or take movement breaks—to improve comfort, prevent chronic pain, and support long-term health.  
This creates an automated “virtual ergonomics coach” that helps workers build healthier habits, reduces absenteeism, and increases productivity.

## Why Edge-Based

- **Privacy-first**: All posture detection runs locally, without sending video data to the cloud.
- **Low latency**: Real-time feedback ensures issues are corrected immediately.
- **Accessibility**: Works with standard laptop or desktop webcams, no special hardware required.

# Functions

1. **Detect** â€“ Track body posture, seating angles, and duration of sedentary behavior via computer vision.
2. **Analyze** â€“ Identify slouching, leaning, or prolonged sitting without breaks.
3. **Coach** â€“ Deliver real-time posture reminders and provide long-term health and productivity reports.

# Key Features
