# Task 3 â€“ Problem Statement Support Material

This file deepens the problem definition with **evidence, references, and user insights**.

---

## Evidence from Research

- WHO (2021): Sedentary behavior is one of the top 4 global health risk factors.
- Finnish Ministry of Social Affairs & Health: 40% of employees experience weekly back or neck pain due to office work.
- Studies show that poor posture reduces productivity by up to 15% (Journal of Ergonomics, 2020).

---

## Expanded User Pain Points

- Office workers: Lack **real-time awareness** of posture → chronic discomfort.
- Employers: **High absenteeism** and rising healthcare costs.
- Consultants: Missing **objective tracking** between visits.

## Supporting Visuals (to be added later)

- Chart: % of Finnish workers reporting back pain.
- Infographic: Costs of poor ergonomics to companies.

## Refined Problem Statement

**Poor posture during prolonged sitting causes chronic pain, productivity loss, and high employer costs. Existing solutions (chairs, wearables, advice) lack objective, real-time feedback. There is no simple, privacy-first tool that helps employees improve posture habits sustainably.**

---

## Summary

The problem is well-documented and significant: poor posture affects both personal health and organizational performance. Existing solutions are fragmented and fail to provide continuous, objective feedback. This validates the need for a new, scalable, privacy-focused approach.
