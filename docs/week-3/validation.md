## User Testing (Prototype Feedback)

- **Anna (office worker)**:

  - Liked the subtle reminders.
  - Suggested gamification (weekly “posture score”).

- **Mikko (HR manager)**:

  - Wanted aggregated dashboards for company wellness reporting.

- **Elina (physiotherapist)**:
  - Asked for exportable data (PDF summary for patients).

---

## Expert Validation

- Physiotherapists confirmed: small nudges → reduce strain significantly.
- Employers agreed: anonymized trend data is crucial for acceptance.

---

## Validation Concerns

- Users remain **conflicted between desktop app vs. web app**.
- Privacy must be emphasized in marketing.

---

## Next Validation Step

- Conduct larger survey (n=20+).
- Pilot with one company department for 2 weeks.

---

## Summary

Early validation confirms user interest and expert support for the concept. While privacy remains the top concern, feedback highlights features such as gamification, dashboards, and data exports as key priorities. Future validation should focus on scaling tests and workplace pilots.
