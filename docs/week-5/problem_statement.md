# Problem Statement - Week 5

## Who?

Primary users remain office workers, but we've identified that students and gamers also spend similar hours at computers and face the same posture issues.

## What?

Poor sitting habits affect not just office workers but anyone who spends extended time at a computer. We've learned that gamers in particular often have even worse posture due to forward-leaning "competitive" positions during gaming sessions.

## Where/When?

The problem occurs during work hours, study sessions, and gaming/leisure time. Gaming sessions can be 4-6 hours without breaks, similar to or worse than office work.

## Why?

- Young people (including gamers) are developing chronic pain earlier
- Gaming involves intense focus that makes users forget about posture
- Current solutions don't address gaming or leisure computer use
- Prevention at younger ages could reduce long-term health impacts

## Updated Problem Statement

People who spend long hours at computers—office workers, students, and gamers—develop poor posture that leads to chronic pain. Gamers are particularly affected due to intense forward-leaning positions during gameplay. Current solutions don't address the varied contexts in which people use computers today.
