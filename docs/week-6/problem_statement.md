# Problem Statement - Week 6

## Who?

Office workers, students, and gamers who spend extended hours at computers. We're finding that gamers represent a significant and underserved segment.

## What?

Poor posture during computer use, with gamers showing particularly severe forward-leaning habits during gameplay. The competitive gaming mindset can lead to extreme posture problems.

## Where/When?

During work, study, and gaming sessions. Gaming sessions often extend 4-8 hours with minimal breaks, and competitive gaming involves intense concentration that completely overrides posture awareness.

## Why?

- Gamers care about their health and performance but have no tools
- Gaming posture often worse than office posture
- Young gamers developing chronic issues early
- Gaming community is tech-savvy and open to solutions

## Problem Statement

Extended computer use across work, study, and gaming contexts leads to chronic pain. Gamers are particularly affected by severe posture issues during intense gameplay but lack any monitoring tools that don't impact game performance. Current solutions ignore the gaming use case entirely.
