## focus shift

Based on user research and feedback, we're recognizing that gamers represent a valuable user segment:

- Highly engaged with technology
- Willing to try new tools
- Experience significant posture problems
- Underserved by existing solutions
- Care about both health and performance

## key insight

Gamers need the same posture monitoring as office workers but with additional requirement: the tool must not impact game performance. CPU usage needs to be minimal (ideally < 10%).
