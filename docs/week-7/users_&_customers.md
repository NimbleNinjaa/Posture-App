# Users & Customers - Week 7

## Customer Segments

1. **Office Workers** — Primary traditional market
2. **Gamers** — Engaged, underserved segment
3. **Students** — Overlap between work and gaming
4. **Employers** — B2B opportunity
5. **Health Professionals** — Clinical use case

## Key Insight

All segments need the same core solution (posture monitoring) but with different priorities:

- Office workers: Focus on work hours, integration with productivity tools
- Gamers: Performance critical, privacy important
- Students: Budget-conscious, tech-savvy
- Employers: Need data and ROI justification
- Health professionals: Want patient tracking and exports

## Strategy

Build one solution that serves all segments with mode switching and customization rather than separate products.
